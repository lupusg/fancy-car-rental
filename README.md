## Reflection
This was a one-week project for a class I was taking called Java Technologies at the Faculty Of Science at the University of Craiova.  
I chose this project because I had the opportunity to create a desktop app, use Java (which I never had done before) and to use my personal experience with all the application with which I have ever interacted (from design to functionality).

It was supposed to be a one-month project, but I was working on another personal project so I had to finish this one in one-week approximately.  
It should have been more complex at first, with a PDF contract generator, a better design, and an administrative panel.

Overall I liked it because I managed to create a decent UI (or so I believe ðŸ™‚).  
And yes, I still hate the functionality, which is horribly implemented.
